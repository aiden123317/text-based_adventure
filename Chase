You chase after the weird tiger creature and come across what looks to be a cave, there are signs all around with
slightly faded words warning against entering. You see the tiger run into the cave and you decide to go in as well.


Inside the cave you finally catch up to the tiger but then all of a sudden you hear an explosion from somewhere
random and the cave starts to shake. Before you can move large stones start to fall and in a panic you run for the
exit but then the path gets blocked by more falling stones, you can try to push through but it may cause more to fall.
The only other thing you would be able to do is wait for someone to come check the cave but who knows how long that
would take or if people even exist still.

1. Push the stones
2. Wait for rescue
