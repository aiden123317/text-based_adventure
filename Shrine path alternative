After rejecting the woman's offer to live with her, you find yourself at the clearing you spotted 
earlier and notice an odd shrine, had that been there when you saw the clearing in the distance 
earlier? That doesn't matter now, as it may have the answers you've been looking for this whole time.


You enter the abandoned shrine and find all sorts of murals depicting deities and cosmic beings, 
you then come across what looks to be an ancient prayer people used to say. You could either say 
it and see if anything happens, or not mess with it at all.


1. Recite the ancient prayer
2. Don't recite the prayer and head deeper into the shrine
