You go down the main road through town. This is the fastest way
to get to the corner store, so you should be able to get home in time to play some games with your friends.

You are walking down the street when you find youself standing in
front of the game store. A new text-based adventure game has just
come out, and you older counsin has been talking about how good it is. You really want to buy it so you ca play wiht
your friends, but the new AAA developers are charging $60 for the game. The store also has a game from last year on sale
for $30, or you could buy the $10 game from an indie developer. You and your friends could have a lot of fun playing the
 new game, or you could pick the cheaper options to make sure you have enough money for groceries.
