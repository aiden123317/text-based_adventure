You decided to say the prayer that was etched into the wall of the shrine and 
at first nothing seems to happen. Then suddenly a part of the wall moves away 
revealing a chamber that had been hidden away


As you make your way down the chamber that had been revealed, you come 
across a fork in the path and can either go left and down a staircase, or 
head to the right down a really long hallway that seems to be changing shape


1. Head down the staircase
2. Head down the hallway
