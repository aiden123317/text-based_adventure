You tell the old woman you were just walking aimlessly around the forest. She let's you be on your way and you walk 
away deeper in the woods you see the clearing from earlier again and decide to head there


As you make your way to the clearing you hear some odd noises from up ahead, and as you approach the clearing, 
what looked like a tiger jumps out of a bush, although something is different about it. The tiger seems to be
more bipedal and standing on it's hind legs, instead of on all fours. Before you manage to make sense of the 
situation the tiger scurries off leaving you quite confused.


You consider chasing this weird tiger-like creature but it could be dangerous and aggresive, it may be a 
better idea to head back to the clearing and see if there is anything of use there.


1. Chase the weird "tiger"
2. Continue to the clearing
