At the clearing you find what looks to be some sort of shrine there, it's clear to be quite old and and is filled with
debris around it. It seems to have been a place of worship once.


You enter the abandoned shrine and find all sorts of murals of deities and cosmic beings, you then come across what 
looks to be an ancient prayer people used to say. You could either say it and see if anything happens, or not mess 
with it at all.


1. Say the prayer
2. Don't say the prayer and head deeper into the shrine
