You wake up in the middle of a forest, but something feels off. It's as if you're not in the same time period or something.
The forest is filled with lush scenery and smells of different flowers are in the air. Civilization is nowhere in
sight, you wonder where you are, and what you should do.


You can see a river in the distance to the north, but there may also be things around the area you woke up in, there's
 also a clearing in the forest to the south.


 1. Head South to the clearing
 2. Search the surrounding area
 3. Head North to the river
