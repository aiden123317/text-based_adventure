As you make your way to the clearing you hear some odd noises from up ahead, and as you approach the clearing, what
looked like a tiger jumps out of a bush, although something is different about it. The tiger seems to be more bipedal
and standing on it's hind legs, instead of on all fours. Before you manage to make sense of the situation the tiger
scurries off leaving you quite confused.

You consider chasing this weird tiger-like creature but it could be dangerous and aggressive, it may be a better idea
to head back to the clearing and see if there is anything of use there.

1. Chase the "tiger"
2. Head to the clearing
