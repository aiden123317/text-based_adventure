You decide not to say the weird prayer and instead continue deeper into the ancient shrine, 
eventually finding this huge mural depicting an armageddon of sorts. Next to the mural you 
find this huge coffin and with similar writings that were on the prayer you had 
passed by earlier.


You consider opening the coffin and seeing what may lay inside, however it may be a bad 
idea as you have no idea what horrors may actually lay in it. Could it be riches or some 
monster? The thought of this makes you wonder if you should just contiue looking around 
instead.

1. Open the coffin
2. Don't open the coffin
