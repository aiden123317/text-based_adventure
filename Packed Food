You reluctantly decide to eat the packaged food and it tastes like dirt and mold, it doesn't make you sick but you
regret eating it anyways. You then suddenly hear footsteps coming towards you, when you turn around you see an old
lady. She looks to be at least 70 years old, with stringy white hair and a lot of wrinkles. She asks you why you're
outside her home and what you're doing.

You can tell her the truth about what happened and how you woke up somewhere random in the forest, or you could
lie and say that you were just walking around the woods, not doing anything for a real purpose.

1. Tell the truth about your situation
2. Lie and say you're out for a walk
