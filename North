You make your way to the river and follow along it for a while, it has a calming feeling and a sense of beauty
as well. You eventually come to a point where in the far distance you can see what looks like a village, finally
some civilization!

It's getting really dark outside now and you should probably go to sleep, but you don't have any shelter so you
may be attacked. If you try to go to village now you may end up coming across as an invader to the village which
may cause people to be hostile.

1. Go during the night
2. Go to sleep
