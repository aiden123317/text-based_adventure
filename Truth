You explain everything that has happened so far and what you know to the old woman and she listens as if she's been
told this before, it's quite odd that she doesn't think you're crazy but maybe she knows something? After you finish
talking she tells you that she remembers something similar happened to her years ago. The old woman proceeds to
explain that this current time we're in is one that take place long after an apocalypse that had almost wiped out
all life, after which animals and people had to adapt or evolve to continue living, some animals even mutating
entirely. The woman says she still doesn't know how to return to the original time period we may have come from and
that she has chosen to live out the rest of her days in this shack she built.
