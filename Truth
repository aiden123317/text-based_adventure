You explain everything that has happened so far and what you know to the old woman and she listens as if she's been
told this before, it's quite odd that she doesn't think you're crazy but maybe she knows something? After you finish
talking she tells you that she remembers something similar happened to her years ago. The old woman proceeds to
explain that this current time we're in is one that take place long after an apocalypse that had almost wiped out
all life, after which animals and people had to adapt or evolve to continue living, some animals even mutating
entirely. The woman says she still doesn't know how to return to the original time period we may have come from and
that she has chosen to live out the rest of her days in this shack she built.


The woman then invites you to stay with her in her home and it seems like a genuine offer, but there might be 
more to this world than just staying here, maybe you can find a way back yourself? Although it might be safer 
here instead and there is no guarentee that there's a way back to your time period


1. Choose to live the woman
2. Reject her offer
