While searching the nearby area you end up finding some bottled water and packaged food. You find it a bit odd that
there would be food in the middle of nowhere and when trying to see the expiration date you learn that the food expired
in 1850, which is odd since food wasn't packaged and didn't have expiration dates back then. You wonder to yourself
what could be going on and proceed though the forest and head deeper in.

Heading deeper into the forest you find a rustic looking shack that seems uninhabited, it could be dangerous and may
fall at any given moment. Not too far away from there you see a berry bush but one you've never seen, however you are
pretty hungry and don't really want to try the packaged food, but it may be poisonous.

1. Eat the packaged food
2. Eat the berries from the bush
